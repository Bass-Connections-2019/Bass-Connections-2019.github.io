              <p class="text-muted">Access to electricity is one of the most important requisites to economic and
                societal development. It is associated with decreased maternal mortality, increased education levels,
                and decreased poverty. <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/er100/readings/nclimate2512.pdf"
                  target="_blank">[P. Alstone, et al. Decentralized energy systems for clean electricity access. ]</a> However, 1 billion people still lack access to electricity. To enable electrification and grid expansion in energy-poor regions, it is crucial to know where the existing infrastructure is. This information can help policymakers and businesses decide on whether to expand the national grid, build a microgrid, or provide direct off-grid solar PV. Current approaches to identifying and mapping energy infrastructure tend to be expensive and time-intensive, consisting of aggregating survey data from the ground level and roughly scaling it across regions. This is where we want to help. </p>

The buildings in Austin and Kitsap are widely spaced, whereas the buildings in Chicago and Vienna are tightly packed. The Kitsap has more green cover and the color of cover is also more green compared to all other cities. The texture of Vienna buildings has a peculiar reddish tone.

                look at a pixel size distribution of the buildings from our target domain. We then decide on sizing
                buckets, and when we synthesize the synthetic textures, we also note the size of the building that the
                texture was synthesized from, so we are able to find a synthetic texture of similar size to substitute
                onto the target building. This ensures that our final output is as realistic as possible, since we can
